# Unit-4-Sorting-Algorithms

Multiple packages containing code from Advanced Placement Computer Science at the Academy of Engineering and Technology. Each package is explained below, but the purpose of this unit is focused on sorting and searching algorithms. Specifically, the Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and the Binary Search. A good reference for more information on these sorts can be found at Geeks for Geeks, TutorialsPoint, or the computer science book that was used in class as an aide, Barron's AP Computer Science A, 7th Edition.

## Bubble Sort (BubbleSort.java)
Performs a bubble sort, or sequential sort, on an array of random ints. The random int array is created based on user input via system in. 

## Deck (DeckTester.java, SortingCards.java)
This package of both resource and application classes create the foundation to create a card game in Java. The Card.java class creates cards with a `faceValue` and a `suit`. Includes getters, setters, and `toString` for both parameters. The Deck.java class creates the deck of 52 `Card`s. It can be dealt, shuffled, ect. The DeckTester.java class tests the Deck class, and the SortingCards.java class sorts a hand of cards into ascending order.
