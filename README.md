# Unit-4-Sorting-Algorithms

Multiple packages containing code from Advanced Placement Computer Science at the Academy of Engineering and Technology. Each package is explained below, but the purpose of this unit is focused on sorting and searching algorithms. Specifically, the Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and the Binary Search. A good reference for more information on these sorts can be found at Geeks for Geeks, TutorialsPoint, or the computer science book that was used in class as an aide, Barron's AP Computer Science A.
